\# An RC car project

This is a work in progress personal project that I started with a goal of building an RC car from scratch with a gyroscopic steering controller imitating real life steering action and to gain experience with STM32 microcontrollers. My initial goal for this project is to complete the basic functioning of the car and steering control. I have planned and I am planning to add more features in the future such as controls to adjust certain parameters to affect the handling of the car, telemetry, lap time counter and even a camera to get a First Person View(FPV)!
